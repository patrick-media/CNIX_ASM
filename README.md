# CNIX_ASM
This repository contains all Visual Studio 2022 files for a very inefficient, yet nearly complete assembler for a very simple and unrealistic assembly language. Unfortunately, an emulator was never finished for this hypothetical CPU - I was focused on the assembling and
compiling as opposed to processor architecture.

### CNIX_ASM
This folder contains all code for the assembler (most working version is in `asm16.c`, with tests included). It was planned for there to be a "16-bit" and "32-bit" version of the assembler, one being more complex than the other. This was originally inspired by the 65C02
processor and its simplicity and versatility.
### CNIX_EMU
This folder contains the very beginning of a previously planned emulator (or more accurately, interpreter) for this assembly language. Originally, the goal was to be able to make a simple video game of NES or Super NES style on my own assembly language and system emulator.
